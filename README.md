# Accountability-App

## Project Description 
Inspired by the people in my life with ADHD, the goal of this project is to create a goal setting tool, with a built in reward (or punishment system). 
The Accountability App allows for 2 types of users:
  1. Goal Setters
  2. Accountability Partners
A Goal Setter using the app, can set a goal, assign to it an Accountability Partner who will monitor the goal setter's progress towards achieving the goal, and attach a monetary reward (invested by the Goal Setter when the goal is set) to the goal. If the Goal Setter successfully achieves their goal, they earn their initial investment back as a reward. If they fail to achieve their goal, however, the money invested in the goal is donated to a predetermined charity of their choice (Goal Setters are encouraged to pick charities they detest to further encourage goal completion).

This project was built with Java and Next.js. The backend system for this project was built with the Java Spring Boot Framework, as a means to allow me to use my knowledge of java and practice my Spring Boot. Additionally, Spring Boot felt like a natural choice for this project due to the extensive security and web configurations features it provides. Similarly, Next.js was chose as the front end development language for this project to allow me to practice my skills with this framework and due to its extensive use in industry. Ultimately, the goal is to migrate this whole project to Web 3 as it is an ideal project to make use of smart contract technology. Thus, this will work as an initial prototype for the ultimate product I intend to build.
